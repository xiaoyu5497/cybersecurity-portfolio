## Project Experience
### Project 1: Secure Network Design and Simulation Using GNS3
**Objective:**  
To design and simulate a secure network topology using GNS3 and gain hands-on experience with routing, VLAN configuration, and basic security controls.
**Tools Used:**  
GNS3, Cisco IOS routers and switches
**Methodology:**  
Designed a multi-network topology in GNS3, configured IP addressing, VLANs, inter-VLAN routing, and basic routing protocols. Implemented basic security practices such as network segmentation and access control through router and switch configurations. Verified connectivity and security through testing and troubleshooting.
**Outcome:**  
Developed practical skills in network design, simulation, and troubleshooting, and gained a deeper understanding of how secure network architectures are built and tested in a virtual environment.
### Project 2: Network Configuration and Security Simulation Using Packet Tracer
**Objective:**  
To design and simulate a small enterprise network using Cisco Packet Tracer and understand basic network security configurations.
**Tools Used:**  
Cisco Packet Tracer, Cisco routers and switches, simulated end devices
**Methodology:**  
Designed a network topology with multiple subnets and VLANs in Packet Tracer. Configured IP addressing, DHCP, inter-VLAN routing, and basic access control using router and switch configurations. Tested network connectivity and verified correct configurations through ping and troubleshooting.
**Outcome:**  
Gained hands-on experience in network configuration and basic security implementation, and strengthened understanding of how network security concepts are applied in simulated environments.
