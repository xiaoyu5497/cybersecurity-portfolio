**Tools Used:**  
GNS3, Cisco IOS routers and switches
**Methodology:**  
Designed a multi-network topology in GNS3, configured IP addressing, VLANs, inter-VLAN routing, and basic routing protocols. Implemented basic security practices such as network segmentation and access control through router and switch configurations. Verified connectivity and security through testing and troubleshooting.
**Outcome:**  
Developed practical skills in network design, simulation, and troubleshooting, and gained a deeper understanding of how secure network architectures are built and tested in a virtual environment.
### Project 2: Network Configuration and Security Simulation Using Packet Tracer
**Objective:**  
To design and simulate a small enterprise network using Cisco Packet Tracer and understand basic network security configurations.
**Tools Used:**  
Cisco Packet Tracer, Cisco routers and switches, simulated end devices
**Methodology:**  
Designed a network topology with multiple subnets and VLANs in Packet Tracer. Configured IP addressing, DHCP, inter-VLAN routing, and basic access control using router and switch configurations. Tested network connectivity and verified correct configurations through ping and troubleshooting.
**Outcome:**  
Gained hands-on experience in network configuration and basic security implementation, and strengthened understanding of how network security concepts are applied in simulated environments.

## Learning Journey
Throughout my cybersecurity studies, I have developed a stronger understanding of networking fundamentals, security principles, and how theoretical concepts are applied in practical scenarios. Hands-on laboratory exercises have helped me better understand topics such as network configuration, traffic analysis, and basic security assessments.
One of the challenges I faced was fully understanding complex networking and security concepts, especially when applying them in real-world scenarios. However, through continuous practice, reviewing course materials, and experimenting with tools, I have gradually improved my confidence and problem-solving skills.
Moving forward, I plan to further strengthen my technical abilities by gaining more hands-on experience, exploring advanced cybersecurity tools, and deepening my understanding of network and system security to better prepare for a professional cybersecurity career.

## Career Objective
My career objective is to pursue a professional role in the cybersecurity field, with a focus on network security and cyber defense. I aim to apply my technical knowledge, hands-on skills, and continuous learning mindset to help organizations protect their systems and networks. In the long term, I hope to further specialize in advanced cybersecurity technologies and contribute to building secure and resilient digital infrastructures.
